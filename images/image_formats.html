    <li> There are three main image formats on the web; PNG, GIF and JPEG.</li>
     <li> A PNG is a photo with a transparent background, great for when you want to have the image blend in with the background of your site.</li>
      <li> A GIF is an often animated image that plays on a 2-3 second cycle. A Gif is great for when you want to make your site feel alive.</li>
       <li> A JPEG is just a regular photo either taken with a digital camera or made on photoshop.</li>
